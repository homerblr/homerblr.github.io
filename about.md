From 2015 till 2020 I served at the Investigative Committee as a Senior Investigator. 
By summer of 2019, I decided to change my favorite but not grateful profession, starting an individual learning after working hours of the basics of Computer Science. 
At the same period, I started to learn the Swift development language using the same individual approach. Due to the high workload, the training was slow, but at the same time daily, no matter of time I came home from the service. 
After leaving the service for understandable reasons in the fall of 2020,  I began an intensive individual study of the mobile development.
